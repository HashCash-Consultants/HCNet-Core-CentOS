# HCNet Core

[![HashCash Consultants](https://github.com/HashCash-Consultants/HCNet-Core/raw/master/img/hashcash-logo.png)](https://www.hashcashconsultants.com/)

HC-net is a open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/HashCash-Consultants/HCNet-Core)

# Build Dependencies

- CPU - dual core 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon
- RAM - 8gb 
- Storage - 500gb
- c++ toolchain and headers that supports c++14
    - `clang` >= 5.0
    - `g++` >= 6.0
- `pkg-config`
- `libpq-dev` unless you `./configure --disable-postgres` in the build step below.
- 64-bit system
- `clang-format-5.0` (for `make format` to work)
-  Postgres db >=9.3 (aurora requires version more than 9.3) 

### CentOS

#### CentOS 7
Just like 14.04, you can install the test toolchain to build and run HCNet-Core.

Alternatively, if you want to just depend on stock 16.04, you will have to build with clang *and* have use `libc++` instead of `libstdc++` when compiling.

After installing packages, head to [building with clang and libc++](#building-with-clang-and-libc).


#### Adding the test toolchain
    # NOTE: newer version of the compilers are not
    #    provided by stock distributions
    #    and are provided by the /test toolchain
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    sudo apt-get update

#### Installing packages
    # common packages
    sudo apt-get install git build-essential pkg-config autoconf automake libtool bison flex libpq-dev
    # if using clang
    sudo apt-get install clang-5.0
    # clang with libstdc++
    sudo apt-get install gcc-6
    sudo apt-get install libc++-dev libc++abi-dev
    # if using g++ or building with libstdc++
    sudo apt-get install gcc-6 g++-6 cpp-6

    # optional: pandoc (to compile man pages)
    sudo apt-get install pandoc

In order to make changes, you'll need to install the proper version of clang-format.

In order to install the llvm (clang) toolchain, you may have to follow instructions on https://apt.llvm.org/

    sudo apt-get install clang-format-5.0


## Basic Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/HashCash-Consultants/HCNet-Core`
- `cd HCNet-Core`
- `git submodule init`
- `git submodule update`
- Type `./autogen.sh`.
- Type `./configure`   *(If configure complains about compiler versions, try `CXX=clang-5.0 ./configure` or `CXX=g++-6 ./configure` or similar, depending on your compiler.)*
- Type `make` or `make -j`(for aggressive parallel build)
- Type `make check` to run tests.
- Type `make install` to install.

## Building with clang and libc++

On some systems, building with `libc++`, [LLVM's version of the standard library](https://libcxx.llvm.org/) can be done instead of `libstdc++` (typically used on Linux).

NB: there are newer versions available of both clang and libc++, you will have to use the versions suited for your system.

You may need to install additional packages for this, for example, on Linux Ubuntu:

    # install libc++ headers
    sudo apt-get install libc++-dev libc++abi-dev

Here are sample steps to achieve this:

    export CC=clang-5.0
    export CXX=clang++-5.0
    export CFLAGS="-O3 -g1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer"
    export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS -stdlib=libc++ -isystem /usr/include/libcxxabi"
    git clone https://github.com/HashCash-Consultants/HCNet-Core
    cd HCNet-Core/
    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make -j6

Postgres database need to install to store core data
## Install postgres database
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```
- Postgres user for HCNet core
```
sudo -s
su â€“ postgres
createuser <username> --pwprompt
Enter password for new role: <Enter password>
Enter it again: <Enter the pwd again>
```
Note: This is required for DB url that need to be maintained in HcNet-core.cfg and if you want to set up 5 nodes, you need to create 5 users.
- After creating the user, you need to add them. So exit from postgres and login as root user.
```
exit
adduser <username>;
```
To verify if user is created, execute following commands
```
su - postgres
psql
\du
```
After that create a database. If you have five cores, then create five databases.
```
CREATE DATABASE <DB_NAME> OWNER <user created username>;
```
